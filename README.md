### What are Fantasy Sports?

Fantasy sports are online games where participants
create teams of real-life sports players. These players
earn points based on the actual performance of their
real-world counterparts. Fantasy sports players
compete against each other in private and public
leagues, and the player with the highest overall score at
the end of the annual season wins. The fantasy sports
industry is experiencing rapid growth, with a projected
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 12-13% and
an expected value of nearly $13 billion by 2028.

### How Does Human Bias Impact FPL?

Like any decisions made by humans, the process of
selecting players for your Fantasy Premier League (FPL)
team is susceptible to various inherent biases.

#### Team loyalty
One of the most prevalent biases is team loyalty,
wherein individuals who invest significant time in
managing their FPL team often exhibit a preference for
players from their favourite Premier League club. This
loyalty, whether consciously or subconsciously, leads to
a certain level of favouritism towards players from their
team of choice, as well as a reluctance to include
players from rival teams. As an Arsenal fan, for instance,
it is often the case for my team to consist of multiple
Arsenal players, even if they may not be the most
optimal choices, while Tottenham players (Arsenal's
biggest rival) are rarely considered. This trend seems to
emerge every year, albeit unintentionally.

#### Recency bias
Recency bias also plays a role in influencing team
selections. If one has recently witnessed a team or
player perform exceptionally well or poorly, there is a
tendency to overemphasize these recent performances
when making decisions for the upcoming weeks
selections.

#### Selected percentage
Another powerful form of bias, which can be both
helpful and misleading, is the players selected
percentage metric. This metric, displayed alongside
each player during the FPL team selection process,
indicates the percentage of FPL players who have
included that player in their teams. While high selected
percentages often indicate players who have been
performing well or offer good value, it is not always a
reliable indicator. Nonetheless, many FPL players tend
to select certain players simply because others have
chosen them, without considering other relevant
factors.

# Project objective
The objective of this project is to mitigate these biases
in all their forms. By developing algorithms and
selection processes solely based on historical data, my
goal is to eliminate human bias and promote purely
data based decision-making in FPL team selection.
